# Task 6: Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
To understand what makes a password strong and evaluate different passwords using online password strength checking tools.

## Tools Used
- Online password strength checker (e.g., PasswordMeter)

## Passwords Tested

| Password | Composition | Strength | Feedback |
|--------|------------|----------|----------|
| password123 | lowercase + numbers | Weak | Very common and predictable |
| Password@1235866 | uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol | Medium | Better but still guessable |
| P@9xL!2#QmZ7 | mixed characters | Strong | High randomness |
| Sun*Rain$Cloud_89 | passphrase + symbols | Very Strong | Long and unpredictable |

## Common Password Attacks
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all combinations until the password is found.
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses common words and leaked passwords.

## Best Practices Learned
- Use long passwords (12+ characters)
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid personal information
- Use unique passwords for every account
- Enable multi-factor authentication
- Use password managers

## Conclusion
Password length and complexity directly improve security. Strong passwords combined with good practices significantly reduce the risk of attacks.
