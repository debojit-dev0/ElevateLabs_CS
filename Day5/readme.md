# Task 5: Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic network protocols.

## Tool Used
- Wireshark

## Steps Performed
1. Started packet capture on the active network interface.
2. Generated traffic by browsing a website and using ping.
3. Captured packets for one minute.
4. Applied protocol filters to analyze traffic.
5. Identified DNS, TCP, and UDP protocols.
6. Exported the capture as a .pcap file.

## Protocols Identified
- DNS: Used for domain name resolution.
- TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented communication.
- UDP: Fast, connectionless communication.

## Conclusion
Wireshark helps in monitoring and analyzing network traffic, which is useful for troubleshooting and security analysis.
